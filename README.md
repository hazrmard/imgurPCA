# imgurPCA v2
Machine Learning using clustering on imgur. Under construction.  

`imgurpca` is a package that uses Principal Component Analysis to extract
patterns from comments on *imgur.com*. It also provides a way to automate tasks
like posting to/ getting notifications from imgur.  

This was my first ever "open source" project that I did just for the sake of it.
`v2` is a thorough rethinking of my approach after a year's hiatus.

See [`docs`](./docs/) folder for more details.
